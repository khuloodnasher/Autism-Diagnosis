# Autism-Diagnosis

###  Diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Machine Learning Techniques

### Introduction
#### Background

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a type of neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and continues throughout a person's life. In this project, Dr. Fayez Thabtah collected data from 1054 toddlers whose ages were less than three years old. The Doctor asked their parents yes/no questions. These questions were behavioral questions and the number of yes were added up and have been recorded in the column called Q chat 10 question. If this column has more than 3 yes, toddlers will be classified as positive ASD.

Our role in this project is to use machine learning techniques to diagnose ASD based on the Dr. Thabtah’s data.

The columns are as follows:

Q chat 10 question features with toddlers
A1: Does your child look at you when you call his/her name?

A2: How easy is it for you to get eye contact with your child?

A3: Does your child point to indicate that s/he wants something?

A4: Does your child point to share an interest with you?

A5: Does your child pretend? e.g. care for dolls, talk on a toy phone?

A6: Does your child follow where you are looking?

A7: If you or someone else in the family is visibly upset, does your child show signs of waning to comfort them? e.g. stroking hair, hugging them)

A8: Would you describe your child's first word as:

A9: Does your child use simple gestures (e.g.wave goodbye)?

A10:Does your child stare at nothing with no apparent purpose?



### Define The Problem
Based on Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) data provided by the ASD Tests app, we will try to develop a simple prediction model for toddlers to predict the probability of showing ASD traits so that their parents/guardians can consider taking steps early enough.



### Important Questions
1-What is good algorithm to diagnose autism?

2- How can I improve my models’ accuracy?

3- What are the most important features in diagnosing autism among children?


### This project was collected over one tousand fifty four patients and 18 features were used


### The percentage of babies shows the symptoms of autisim



### The distribution of the target column
