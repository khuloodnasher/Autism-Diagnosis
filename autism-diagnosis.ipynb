In this project, Dr. Fayez Thabtah collected data from 1054 toddlers whose ages were less than three years old. The Doctor asked their parents yes/no questions. These questions were behavioral questions and the number of yes were added up and have been recorded in the column called Q chat 10 question. If this column has more than 3 yes, toddlers will be classified as positive ASD.\n### Our role in this project is to use machine learning techniques to diagnose ASD based on the Dr. Thabtah’s data.\n\n\nSource of Data:\n\nFayez Thabtah\n\nDepartment of Digital Technology\nManukau Institute of Technology \nAuckland, New Zeland\n\nThe columns are as follows:\n\n### Q chat 10 question features with toddlers \n\nA1: Does your child look at you when you call his/her name?\n\nA2: How easy is it for you to get eye contact with your child?\n\nA3: Does your child point to indicate that s/he wants something?\n\nA4: Does your child point to share an interest with you?\n\nA5: Does your child pretend? e.g. care for dolls, talk on a toy phone?\n\nA6: Does your child follow where you are looking?\n\nA7: If you or someone else in the family is visibly upset, does your child show signs of waning to comfort them? e.g. stroking hair, hugging them)\n\nA8: Would you describe your child's first word as:\n\nA9: Does your child use simple gestures (e.g.wave goodbye)?\n\nA10:Does your child stare at  nothing with no apparent purpose?\n\n\n\n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"EHQNrFvaY7R-"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Define The Problem \nBased on Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT)

100%,Recall,Precision,F1score are 100% for both yes autisim and no autisim patients, FP and False negative= Zero. \n\n### Logistic Regression with default parameters is an ideal model.\n\n### LinearDiscriminantAnalysis \n\nLinearDiscriminantAnalysis has training and testing and Recall accuracy= 96% So LinearDiscriminantAnalysis is also very good model. \n\n### KNN model \n\nKNN model has test accuracy: 0.91,train accuracy: 0.95, and weight average Recall = 91% for positive cases , so KNN is good model. \n\n### Decsion tree model\n\nDecsion tree model has test accuracy: 0.91 and train accuracy: 1.0. This model has to be hypertuned to adjust the overfitting, so it is not accepted.\n\n### NaieveBays model\n\n NaieveBays model has test accuracy: 0.94,train accuracy: 0.95, and Weighted average Recall for positive cases =94%,so naieve bayes is a good model.\n\n### Support vector machine and Random forest\n\nSupport vector machine and Random forest have low accuracy score before hypertunned, so they are rejected. \n\n### XG Boosting\n\nXG Boosting has test accuracy: 0.99,train accuracy: 1.0,and Weighted average Recall for positive cases =99%, \n\n###So XG Boosting is an ideal model ranked number#2 after logistic Regression.\n\n### GradientBoosting and ADA Boosting \n\n GradientBoosting and ADA Boosting have low accuracy, so they are rejected. In summary out of these 10 models, I will choose Logist Regression, and XG Boosting.\n\n### Support Vector Machine after hypertunned\n\nSupport Vector Machine after hypertuned through grid search with no pipeline used has test accuracy: 1.0 and train accuracy: 0.48. This model has underfitting and it is rejected.\n\n### Random Forest  \n\nRandom forest classifier before hypertune Recall was 47% and after \n\nhypertuning recall is 97%, also False negative 156/422=37% before hypertune \n\nbut after hypertune the false negative is only 8/422 = 0.02% meaning this \n\nmodel misclassifies only 0.02% and this is great mode. We have a weighted \n\naverage recall and precision of 0.96.  It means we are able to detect the positive autisim patient with 96% accuracy which is a good accuracy. We don't have overfitting because test accuracy: 0.96 while the train accuracy: 0.98. \n\n### Neural Network Classifier Using SKLearn\n\nNeural Network Classifier Using SKLearn has a test accuracy: 0.99 and train accuracy: 1.0, and Weighted average Recall =99%,\n\n### so Neural Network Classifier Using SKLearn is an ideal model.\n\n\n\n\nA9 is the most  important feature , A5,A6, are part of important features\n\nWe used gridsearch to find the best parameters.\n\nWe used pipeline to prrevent data leakage and to have clean code.\n\n\n### Neural Network Classifier Using Keras Library\nAccuracy is 95% so this model is a good model.\n\n\n\n### In Conclusion\n### Models\n* Logistic Regression, XG Boosting and Neural Network are good models in our autism project with it small sample size.\n### Important Features\n* A9 is the most important features, other important features are A6, A5, and A8. Jandice and the type of gender'sex' are less important features. Genes in this study which appears through the column of family member with ASD is not an important feature\n* Males are more positive to autism than females.\n* Ages close to 36 months which is three years old show more positive autism.\n* White European, Asian and middle eastern are the ethnicities that showed an increase in autism cases.\n\n\n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"ZBH8S43CHTGA"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Recommendation\n\n- Apply Logistic Regression, XG Boosting or  neural network using sklearn for high accuracy model to diagnose Autisim.\n\n- Diagnose  deeply and early autisim disease among particular ethnicity particularly  White European, Asian and middle East.\n\n- Try to find more state of art in tracing autisim symptoms among toddlers in ages less than three years.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"ZpOJFLr_ItXW"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Future Work\n* Reach out the same clininc and get more data either with number of diagnosed patients or with more features used for diagnosis.\n\n* Suggest to the main researcher to try numeric features as much as possible.\n\n* Search other Autusim data around the world and do the same approch used in this project.\n\n\n* Apply the same models on adults\n\n\n*  Model with image data of cases daignosed with autisim using X-ray","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
